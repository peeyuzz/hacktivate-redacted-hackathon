For each piece of sensitive information you detect, create a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "text": [the exact text detected as sensitive],
  "reason": [2 or 3 words explaining why it was detected],
  "level": [level of sensitivity: low, medium, high]
}


Analyze the entire text thoroughly and return a list of these JSON objects for all detected sensitive information. Be comprehensive in your detection, but avoid false positives by carefully considering the context of each potential sensitive item.

Remember, your analysis will be used in a redaction application, so accuracy and completeness are crucial for maintaining document security and privacy.

Since the text has been obtained after OCR on scanned documents, you need to make sense from the gibberish ocr-ed text.

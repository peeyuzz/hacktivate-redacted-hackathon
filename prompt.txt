For each piece of sensitive information you detect, create a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "text": [the exact text detected as sensitive],
  "reason": [2 or 3 words explaining why it was detected],
  "level": [level of sensitivity: low, medium, high (follow the level provided in brackets above, unless the context suggests otherwise)]
}

You have been provided with the screenshot of the page, understand the context of text using the it to better identify which part of text is actually sensitive.

Analyze the entire text thoroughly and return a list of these JSON objects for all detected sensitive information. Be comprehensive in your detection, but avoid false positives by carefully considering the context of each potential sensitive item.

Remember, your analysis will be used in a redaction application, so accuracy and completeness are crucial for maintaining document security and privacy.

It is not necessary that the text contains sensitive information, you dont have to forcefully label text as sensitive. Be conservative in your approach. False-negatives are better than false-positives
Since the text has been obtained after OCR on scanned documents, you need to make sense from the gibberish ocr-ed text.
